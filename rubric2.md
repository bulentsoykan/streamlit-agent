| **Problem List**                                                        | Misses active and chronic (stable or unstable) problems, non-prioritized                                                                       | Identifies most major active and stable chronic problems, attempts to generate prioritized problem list, may not be grouped                                                    | Lists all active and chronic (stable or unstable) problems, generates bulleted, complete, prioritized problem list grouped by related signs, symptoms or syndromes                                 |
| **Summary Statement**                                                   | None                                                                                                                                           | Present but unorganized, does not include pertinent information or includes information that is not pertinent or incorrect. Lacks data synthesis or repeats HPI.               | Organized, concise, uses semantic vocabulary to highlight pertinent HPI, PE and data that argues for their leading diagnosis.                                                                      |
| **Problem-based Assessment**                                            | Identifies most major problems but misses some minor problems from HPI, no evidence of ranking by clinical importance. Minimal data synthesis. | Addresses all major active problems, may not group signs and symptoms by syndrome, attempts to generate prioritized problem list. Demonstrates some synthesis of gathered data | Completely addresses all active and stable problems in a prioritized manner. Groups signs and symptoms by syndrome. Demonstrates appropriate synthesis of gathered data                            |
| **Differential Diagnosis: Comprehensiveness, accuracy, prioritization** | Diagnostic possibilities are not reasonable nor plausible. No prioritization                                                                   | Provides reasonable diagnostic considerations but does not indicate priority nor a leading diagnosis. There are inaccuracies in the differential                               | Offers an accurate, prioritized, AND plausible list of diagnostic possibilities; indicates a leading diagnosis, considers what is most likely, less likely, or unlikely yet important to consider. |
| **Differential Diagnosis: Justification**                               | Does not demonstrate reasoning or offer support for leading diagnosis; justification is not based on sound medical knowledge or is incorrect   | Does not consistently cite reasons for/against each diagnosis. Identifies leading diagnosis                                                                                    | Explains the reasoning behind the lead diagnosis and alternative diagnoses including the epidemiology and key features and how these compare/contrast with the patient's presentation.             |
